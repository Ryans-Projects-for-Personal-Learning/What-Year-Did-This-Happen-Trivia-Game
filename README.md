# What Year Did This Happen? Trivia Game
This is a simple trivia game that tests one's knowledge of history. Given an event, the player must correctly guess what year it happened.

This is a quick project for learning about how to use APIs made by other people for your own projects. The API used is called [NumbersAPI](http://numbersapi.com/), which contains facts about different numbers.

Becuase the url of the API is not served over HTTPS, I am not able to host this project for you to try. However, you can clone this repository and launch it locally to try it for yourself.
